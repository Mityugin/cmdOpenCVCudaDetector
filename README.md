# cmdOpenCVCudaDetector

Using https://gist.github.com/YashasSamaga code for my OpenCV IP camera real time object detection

You need download from here DNN model files **yolov4-tiny.cfg** and **yolov4-tiny.weights** (using here mini YOLOv4 models, you can change to full)
and **classes80.txt** for classes list and place it all to folder C:\TEMP

classes80.txt looks like this so you can change what to detect (using 80, full list contains about 9k classes):

* person
* bicycle
* car
* motorcycle
* airplane
* bus
* train
* truck
* boat
* traffic light
* fire hydrant
* stop sign
* parking meter
* bench
* bird
* cat
* dog
